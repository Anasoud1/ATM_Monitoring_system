# ATM Monitoring System

## Introduction

Welcome to the ATM Monitoring System ! This project aims to build a system that monitors ATM machines of a bank and helps making decisions about replenishment time and maintenance operations. You can access the deployed site [here](#) and read the final project blog article [here](#).

Inspiration:
As a passionate advocate for efficient financial systems, I embarked on this project to address the need for robust monitoring solutions in ATM networks. Inspired by real-world challenges faced by financial institutions, I set out to create a tool that empowers administrators to ensure ATM uptime, security, and performance.

Technical Challenge:
The ATM Monitoring System presented a unique blend of technical and domain-specific challenges. Balancing real-time data collection, anomaly detection, and user-friendly visualization required innovative solutions. Throughout the development process, I grappled with optimizing database queries for large-scale data, implementing secure authentication mechanisms, and designing intuitive user interfaces.

Struggles:
One of the key struggles I encountered was fine-tuning the anomaly detection algorithms. Achieving the delicate balance between sensitivity to anomalies and minimizing false positives demanded iterative experimentation and validation against diverse datasets. Additionally, ensuring compatibility with various ATM models and protocols posed integration hurdles that pushed me to explore interoperability solutions.

Next Iteration:
Looking ahead, I envision expanding the system's capabilities to incorporate predictive maintenance algorithms, leveraging machine learning models to anticipate potential issues before they arise. Furthermore, enhancing the system's scalability and resilience through microservices architecture is a priority for future iterations.
